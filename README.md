# PongSharp

PongSharp is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game, written in C# for the Console/CMD. Play a fun, fast-paced game of Pong against a computer opponent, or challenge a friend on the same device!

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Play with a friend on the same device. (WASD & Arrow Keys)
- **Console-based graphics**: Enjoy a retro, text-based Pong experience. (Its Bad, I'll Fix That Later Though!)
- **Simple controls**: Control paddles using the keyboard. (Like I Said Above!)
